Question: 
What genes, HMOs, bacteria have been found to be associated with NEC?
How do the genes, HMOs and bacteria associated with NEC interact with eachother to make a cohesive underlying biological story?

Relations

1) hmo - bac relations; do hmos interact directly with bacteria?
hmo_i inhibits bac_j
bac_i inhibited by hmo_j
bac_i consumes hmo_j
hmo_i competitively inhibits bac_i
hmo_i competitively inhibits __ receptor of bac_i

2) gene - hmo relations; do hmos interact (in)directly with cells
gene_i competes for hmo_j
gene_i is necessary for hmo_j synthesis

3) bac-bac and gene-gene; do indirect gene and/or bacteria interactions modulate the hmo effects
gene_i upregulates gene_j
gene_i downregulates gene_j
gene_i expresses gene_j
gene_i binds gene_j

bac_i competes with bac_j
bac_i mutualism bac_j
bac_i parasitism bac_j
bac_i synnecrosism bac_j
bac_i symbiosis bac_j

2) hmo - hmo relations; how does the competative nature of biosynthesis regulate hmo availibility?
hmo_i precursor hmo_j
hmo_i product hmo_j
hmo_i product hmo_j and ___

5) catch-all
x activates y
x inhibits y
